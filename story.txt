One fateful time, December 13, a small meteor whistled through the Earth's atmosphere, burning a thin yellow streak through the clear night air. The meteor dropped into a stream of the illustrious small town, Castenoga.

A small change crept into the town. Maybe it was the air, maybe it was the water. Minds were sharpened. Talents sprang out. You could say that everyone suddenly came upon their full potential. 

Lady Spring was the first to really use her enhancement looks. 
Robert Pry started cooking delicious concoctions. 
Little boy Charley started levitating tiny metal objects.
